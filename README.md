Loan Data Analysis & Insights
📌 Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a loan dataset to uncover key insights into customer behavior. The analysis focuses on loan distribution, customer demographics, and financial trends using Python and data visualization techniques.

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes customer details such as age, marital status, job, education, and loan status.
The goal is to analyze how different factors influence loan approvals and customer behavior.
🚀 Key Analysis & Insights
✅ Loan vs. Marital Status: Married individuals are more likely to take loans.
✅ Education vs. Job Role: Higher education leads to better job opportunities.
✅ Previous Campaigns Matter: Customers who accepted loans before are more likely to accept again.
✅ Loan Approvals by Month: May is the most active month for customer engagement.

📊 Visualizations & Findings
This project includes data visualizations such as:
📌 Bar Charts – Loan status by marital status
📌 Count Plots – Loan approval rates across different months
📌 Stacked Bar Charts – Job distribution based on education levels
